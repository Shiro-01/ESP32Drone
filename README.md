# Droony - ESP32 Drone Flight Controller

Welcome to **Droony**, an open-source drone flight controller project based on ESP32. This project integrates sensor fusion, PID control loops, and wireless control via RemoteXY Wi-Fi interface to enable stable quadcopter flight.

## Features

- **ESP32 based flight controller** with multitasking support
- Sensor integration:
  - WT901 IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) via I2C
  - Barometer for altitude measurement
  - ADC voltage monitoring for battery status
- PID Controllers for pitch and roll stabilization
- PWM motor control with ESC output (4 motors)
- Wireless remote control using **RemoteXY** via Wi-Fi Access Point mode
- Real-time telemetry data displayed on RemoteXY GUI:
  - Voltage
  - Altitude
  - Pitch & Roll angles
  - Flight status
  - Remaining flight time estimation

### RemoteXY GUI Overview

The interface provides:

- Two joysticks controlling throttle and direction
- PID tuning sliders (P, I, D gains)
- Arm/Disarm toggle switch
- Calibration button
- Live telemetry values:
  - Voltage (V)
  - Altitude (m)
  - Pitch and Roll (¬∞)
  - Flight time left (minutes)
  - Status message

### PID Tuning Parameters

| Parameter | Default Value | Description                           |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Kp        | 0.15          | Proportional gain                  |
| Ki        | 0.10          | Integral gain                     |
| Kd        | 0.02          | Derivative gain                   |
| Filter T  | 0.0053        | Sampling time / cutoff frequency  |

These parameters can be tuned dynamically from the RemoteXY GUI to optimize flight stability.

## Notes & Tips

- Ensure your ESCs and motors are compatible with the PWM frequency and signal range.
- Calibrate the IMU before first flight using the calibration button.
- Monitor battery voltage carefully to avoid crashes due to low power.
- Start PID tuning with low gains and gradually increase to avoid oscillations.
- Disarm the drone when not flying to avoid motor spinning.
